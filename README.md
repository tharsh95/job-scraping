# FastAPI Web Scraper with AI Analysis

## Overview
This project is a FastAPI application that performs the following tasks:
1. Scrapes content from a given URL using an async scraper.
2. Analyzes the scraped content using an AI agent.
3. Provides results through a RESTful API.

## Features
- **Web Scraping**: Extracts content from JavaScript-rendered websites using Playwright.
- **AI Analysis**: Uses an AI agent to analyze content and provide structured responses.
- **Authorization**: Secured with an API key in the `Authorization` header.
